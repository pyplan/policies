In order to ensure a strong, secure foundation, Pyplan Cloud shares security responsibilities with an industry leading cloud infrastructure vendor and valued partner.
All data is stored using AWS services, in private networks that can only be accessed through the application.

The security policies in our offices are as follows:

- Access to the local network is through mac address registration. 
- The local network is segmented in 3 sub-networks (not accessible to each other):
  
  - main network
  - secondary network
  - guest network
- Access administration is performed by qualified personnel, with clear and defined responsibilities.

Do you have a mobile device policy?
-----------------------------------

In order to ensure a strong, secure foundation, Pyplan Cloud shares security responsibilities with an industry leading cloud infrastructure vendor and valued partner.
All data is stored using AWS services, in private networks that can only be accessed through the application.
Since the data is stored only using AWS services, the mobile phone usage policies are reduced to the following:

- prior to initial use on the network or related infrastructure, all personally owned mobile devices must be registered with IT.
- utilize a device lock with authentication, such as a fingerprint or strong password, on each participating device. Refer to the  password policy for additional information.
- it is essential that mobile users not use unencrypted connections to WiFi access points, and even encrypted public WiFi access should only be used if absolutely necessary.
- employees agree to never disclose their passwords to anyone, particularly to family members, if business work is conducted from home.
- exercise reasonable physical security measures. It is the end users responsibility to keep their equipment safe and secure.
- a device’s firmware/operating system must be up-to-date in order to prevent vulnerabilities and make the device more stable. The patching and updating processes are the responsibility of the owner.
- any non-corporate computers used to synchronize with the  equipment will have installed anti-virus and anti-malware software deemed necessary by IT Department. Anti-virus signature files must be up to date on any additional client machines – such as a home PC – on which this media will be accessed.
