Data exchange between tenants and Pyplan Cloud 
----------------------------------------------

There are different alternatives to have access to data placed in the custormers network as from Pyplan Cloud. The main ones are: 

- Data synchronization using our Secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP) server. 
- Use of specific Python libraries (e.g. python clients for the main clouds such as AWS, Azure, GPC). 
- Integration using APIs.
